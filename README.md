## Personality Model

We use the scientifically validated **Big Five** personality model (OCEAN) to split traits into 30 subdimensions. Then we analyze responses, normalize them, and apply **KMeans clustering** to:

* Match users with career domains
* Suggest behavioral growth paths

## Dataset

The clustering model is trained on synthetic or anonymized personality response data to identify patterns across professions and personal growth metrics.
